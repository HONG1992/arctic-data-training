# Data science training for Arctic research

- **Dates**: July 31 - Aug 1, 2017
- **Venue**: [NCEAS](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu), 735 State St., Suite 300, UC Santa Barbara
- **Map**: [Google Map walking directions to NCEAS](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/The+Upham,+1404+De+La+Vina+St,+Santa+Barbara,+CA+93101/National+Center+for+Ecological+Analysis+and+Synthesis,+State+Street,+Santa+Barbara,+CA/@34.4221671,-119.7065893,17z/data=!4m15!4m14!1m5!1m1!1s0x80e9148822769e85:0xc358fcc88cab97e3!2m2!1d-119.7093435!2d34.423488!1m5!1m1!1s0x80e914791c310e7d:0x8909b8f14fb78d15!2m2!1d-119.699506!2d34.419271!3e2!5i2) 
    - When you get to NCEAS, take the elevators to the third floor
    - Morning sessions start at 8:30 am, so leaving the Upham at 8:00 am would work well

## Course overview

The [Arctic Data Center](https://arcticdata.io) conducts training in data science and management,
both of which are critical skills for stewardship of data, software, and other
products of research that are preserved at the [Arctic Data Center](https://arcticdata.io).

Course topics will include:

- Arctic Data Center and NSF Standards and Policies 
- Data Management Plans 
- Effective data management for data preservation
    - Storing and Preparing Data in Open Source Formats 
    - Stability, longevity, interoperability 
    - Metadata 
- Publishing data at the Arctic Data Center
    - Web-based submission
    - Automating submission for large data sets
- Data and Metadata Quality
- Provenance for data and software
