- **Venue**: POLAR 2018, Davos, Switzerland (Room A Schwarzhorn)

## Course overview

The [Arctic Data Center](https://arcticdata.io) conducts training in data science and management,
both of which are critical skills for stewardship of data, software, and other
products of research that are preserved at the [Arctic Data Center](https://arcticdata.io).

In this hands-on session, we will cover:

- About open data archives, especially the Arctic Data Center
- What science metadata is and how it can be used
- How data and code can be documented and published in open data archives
    - Web-based submission
    - Submission using R (extra credit, likely insufficient time)
